              Peace should be understood in a human way - in a broad social,
              political and economic way. Peace is threatened by unjust
              economic, social and political order, absence of democracy,
              environmental degradation and absence of human rights. We have a
              list of human rights - right to food, right to shelter, right to
              health, right to education, many such items which are considered
              and accepted as bill of rights. These are to be insured to people.
              So all nations, all societies try to do that.
